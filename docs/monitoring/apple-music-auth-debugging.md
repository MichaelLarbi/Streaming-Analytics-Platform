# Apple Music Authentication - Debugging Notes

## Issue Resolution - SAP-33
**Date:** January 31, 2025
**Issue:** Lambda function not being invoked from frontend
**Resolution:** Updated frontend environment variables

### Root Cause
Frontend environment variables were not properly configured, causing the API requests to fail silently.

### Solution Steps
1. Created/Updated `.env` file in frontend directory with correct API endpoint:
```
VITE_API_ENDPOINT=https://0o0aso95ik.execute-api.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev
```

2. Enhanced AppleMusicAuth component with additional debugging
3. Restarted frontend development server

### Verification Steps
1. Clear browser cache and local storage
2. Test connection to Apple Music
3. Verify Lambda logs in CloudWatch
4. Confirm successful authentication response

### Key Learnings
- Always verify environment variables when API calls fail silently
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Ensure API Gateway endpoint is correctly specified in .env file
- Monitor CloudWatch logs to confirm Lambda invocation

### Related Configuration Files
- Frontend Environment: `/frontend/.env`
- Auth Component: `/frontend/src/components/auth/AppleMusicAuth.jsx`
- Lambda Function: `/Infrastructure/CloudFormation/auth/apple-music/index.js`

### Future Considerations
1. Add environment variable validation on frontend startup
2. Implement automated testing for API connectivity
3. Add more comprehensive error logging
4. Consider adding health check endpoint
