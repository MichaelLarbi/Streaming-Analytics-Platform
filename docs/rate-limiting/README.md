# Rate Limiting Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document details the successful implementation of the API Gateway rate limiting system for the Streaming Analytics Platform (SAP-25).

## Configuration
The rate limiting system is implemented using AWS API Gateway with the following limits:

- **Burst Limit:** 5 requests
- **Rate Limit:** 2 requests per second

## Implementation Details
- Located in: `Infrastructure/CloudFormation/rate-limiting/api-rate-limiting.yaml`
- Stack Name: streaming-analytics-rate-limiting
- Region: eu-west-2 (London)

## Testing Results
Testing confirmed successful rate limiting behavior:
1. Initial burst of requests (10 concurrent):
   - First 5-7 requests succeed (using burst capacity)
   - Remaining requests throttled appropriately

2. Subsequent requests:
   - Limited to 2 per second as configured
   - Excess requests receive 429 "Too Many Requests" response

## Verification Method
- Test script: `Infrastructure/testing/test-rate-limiting.sh`
- Test sends two batches of 10 concurrent requests
- 1-second delay between batches
- Results show proper throttling behavior

## Maintenance Notes
- Monitor API Gateway metrics in CloudWatch
- Review rate limits periodically based on usage patterns
- Adjust limits if needed using CloudFormation updates

## Update Instructions
To modify rate limits:
1. Update parameters in CloudFormation template
2. Run update-stack command
3. Verify changes with test script
